# Contributing to gdscript-transpiler-bin
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Codeberg
We use codeberg to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Git Flow](https://docs.codeberg.org/collaborating/pull-requests-and-git-flow/), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git Flow](https://docs.codeberg.org/collaborating/pull-requests-and-git-flow/). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the CI passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Codeberg's issue tracker
We use Codeberg issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://codeberg.org/LinuxUserGD/gdscript-transpiler-bin/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from 
- [Godot's GDScript Conventions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
